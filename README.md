Project Background:
The main goal of this project is to design and develop a website that meets the specific requirements outlined in the ELITMUS Assignment. The website should address the challenge stated in the assignment, and make use of innovative design and advanced technology to provide an effective solution. The ultimate objective is to create a seamless and engaging user experience, where users can easily interact with the website and achieve their intended goals. By successfully meeting these objectives, the website will provide a valuable resource to its users, while also showcasing the skills and expertise of the development team.

Objectives:
The website aims to assess the user's soft skills by presenting them with a series of challenging tasks that put their perseverance, presence of mind, time management, and problem-solving abilities to the test. As the user completes each task, they make progress towards unraveling the main riddle. This process challenges the user to showcase their mettle, fortitude, and resourcefulness, in order to ultimately triumph over the complex challenge presented to them. By presenting users with an engaging and stimulating experience that fosters personal growth and development, the website aims to provide a unique and rewarding experience that benefits both the user and the broader community.


Tech Stack:

The application has been designed and developed using a client-server architecture. The client-side of the application has been built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, while Bootstrap provides a collection of pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components for building responsive and mobile-first web applications. JavaScript, a versatile programming language, has been used to create interactive and dynamic elements of the web pages.

On the server-side of the application, the Flask framework has been utilized. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that provides a range of tools for routing, handling requests, and working with templates. Flask makes it easy to create dynamic web pages by providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing server-side logic. With Flask, developers can quickly and efficiently build web applications that are reliable, scalable, and secure.
